# Reflec-Ts Example

A small set of TypeScript files along with a [reflection metadata module](./src/generated/reflect-info.ts) which contains all information about classes and interfaces. This module has been generated by a source code post-processor that I'm working on (reflec-ts), that uses the compiler API to extract metadata and save it according to the [rbucton's proposal](https://gist.github.com/rbuckton/f6ee6fcdcc21d44fdfa0).

The aim of this github space is to discuss with the TypeScript dev team and the community about the functioning and the API of this forthcoming new project, currently in a prototyping stage.
